# Challenge 9 - Slicing Figma design into code with Next JS

# Description

In this assignment, you'll translate a provided Figma design into a functional webpage using Next JS and Tailwind CSS, then deploy it using vercel. After you deploy the app, update the readme below.
Hosted web URL: ....

You'll be provided with a basic project setup, and your task will be to implement the design by writing components that reusable and utilizing Tailwind's classes.

The design for this assignment is located at the following Figma link:

[Figma Design Link](https://www.figma.com/design/PjR3Adxi8eZbS2cmdPuG52/Front-End-Developer-Test---Movie-Explorer-App?node-id=8411-143671&p=f)

The goal is to assess your ability to:

- Interpret a design from Figma.
- Create a reusable component
- Structure a webpage with Next JS.
- Apply styles using Tailwind CSS.
- Create a responsive layout.
- Routing and rendering method
- Next Optimization
- Deployment

# Assignment Objectives

- Figma to HTML: Accurately translate the Figma design into HTML. Create the necessary HTML elements to structure the page (divs, sections, headers, etc.).
- Tailwind CSS Styling: Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the HTML elements. Pay close attention to:
- Layout (Flexbox, Grid).
- Spacing (padding, margin).
- Typography (font sizes, weights, colors).
- Colors and Backgrounds.
- esponsive design (using Tailwind's responsive prefixes, e.g., md:, lg:).
- Responsive Design: Ensure your implementation is responsive across different screen sizes, as defined in the Figma design. Use Tailwind's responsive modifiers.
- Adherence to Design: Your final webpage should closely match the visual design provided in the Figma file.
- Deploy your next app

# Getting Started

for this project first, then to run the app, run

```
npm run dev
```

on terminal

Study the Figma Design: Open the Figma link and thoroughly examine the design. Understand the layout, spacing, colors, typography, and responsive behavior.

HTML Structure: Open the public/index.html file. Begin by structuring the page with HTML elements that mirror the design.

Tailwind CSS: Use Tailwind CSS classes directly within your HTML elements to apply styles. For example:

<div class="flex justify-center items-center">...</div>

<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600">...</h1>

Test in the Browser: Run npm run dev to see it on your browser

Iterate: Continue to refine your HTML and Tailwind CSS until your webpage accurately matches the Figma design.

# Important Notes

You can modify the folder structure only on src and public folder, don't change anything related to project setup

Tailwind CSS Documentation: Refer to the official Tailwind CSS documentation (https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for information on available classes and how to use them.

Figma Inspection: Use the "Inspect" feature in Figma to get precise measurements, colors, and font styles from the design.

# Evaluation System

The evaluation for this assignment will be based on the following criteria:

1.  **Basic concept and project structure:** How you understand the concept of next js and how you manage the project structure
2.  **Routing and rendering method:** How you manage routing and rendering method (CSR, SSR, SSG)
3.  **Next js advance features and optimizations:** How you use next js optimized tools like next/image etc.
4.  **Deployment & best practice:** How you deploy your app on vercel
